# Notion Database PDF Export Tool

## Overview
This document outlines requirements for a tool that exports Notion database pages to a merged PDF for text-to-speech reading.

## Problem Statement
Currently, exporting multiple Notion database pages to PDF requires manual effort to export and merge individual pages. The goal is to automate this process to create a single merged PDF that can be read aloud using Microsoft Edge's text-to-speech feature. This enables audio consumption of in-depth topic content stored across multiple database pages.

## Goals & Objectives
- Automate the export of Notion database pages to PDF
- Merge multiple PDF exports into a single file
- Enable easy text-to-speech consumption via Microsoft Edge
- Reduce manual effort in the export and merge process

## User Stories
As a user, I want to:
- Configure Notion API credentials and database ID
- Automatically export all pages from a specified Notion database to PDF
- Have the exported PDFs automatically merged into a single file
- Open the merged PDF in Edge browser for text-to-speech reading

## Features & Requirements

### Core Features
1. Notion Integration
   - Connect to Notion API using provided credentials
   - Retrieve all pages from specified database
   - Export each page to PDF format

2. PDF Processing
   - Download PDF exports from Notion
   - Merge multiple PDFs into single file
   - Clean up individual PDF files after merge

3. Configuration
   - Read API credentials from environment variables
   - Support database ID configuration
   - Handle authentication securely

### Technical Requirements
1. Dependencies
   - Notion API client
   - PDF processing library
   - Environment configuration

2. Performance
   - Handle large databases efficiently
   - Process exports in parallel where possible

3. Error Handling
   - Graceful handling of API failures
   - Clear error messages for configuration issues
   - Recovery from partial failures

## Implementation Notes
- Use Python for implementation
- Leverage Notion's official API
- Store credentials in .env file
- Output merged PDF to local filesystem

## Success Metrics
- Successful export of all database pages
- Correct merging of PDFs
- Readable output in Edge text-to-speech

## Future Considerations
- Support for selective page export
- Progress reporting for long exports
- Custom PDF metadata
- Export format options
